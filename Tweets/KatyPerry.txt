Who’s your favorite Katy Vision character - Lefty or Ebi (Twerking Tempura)? 
I want to close this with a poll... 
...For example, Santa Barbara Katy is actually what I wear in Santa Barbara - hippie linen flow #AppStoreChat
I wanted to pick highlights from every era, not just current ones &amp; I wanted to reflect who I am on and off stage... 
Ha! Pulling the tech curtain aside to tell you it's just a random name generator, but makes me LOL every time. 
...like my hot pink Moschino dress, could become tangible to you in the future... #AppStoreChat
Expect the unexpected! For example, things that you see in that alternate world... 
...Almost 75% of those locations will be places I’ve had IRL memorable moments in. #AppStoreChat
...the game will continue to update with new locations throughout its lifetime...
I incorporated some of my favorites places in the game, from my hometown of Santa Barbara to Tokyo... 
...and in the reality of the music industry, you must have talent first and foremost. #AppStoreChat
...record label has helped write this storyline, but at the end of the day, this is not a talent-based game, it's a skill-based game...
I think there are actual tools that can set you on the path. For example, my experience with starting my own... 
...I don't think we're that far off. #AppStoreChat
I would say Katy Vision, but according to the technology I saw during my visit to Silicon Valley last week... 
I thought this would be fun way to tell my story and offer insight through poppy cartoon visuals. #AppStoreChat
I enjoy creating alternate worlds... 
...for example, my holiday onesies are in your game closets now, as they are in my real closet #AppStoreChat
My favorite thing is to be able to update the game in real time per my imagination... 
...it will be a continually interactive space where a lot of my creative branches can live &amp; I can offer them a lot of firsts #AppStoreChat
That it entertwines so much of my actual history with exclusive, fun reveals along the way... 
...the reality of my musical experience in more colors than the rainbow #AppStoreChat
Virtual Katy allows u a sneak peek into my imagination combined with...

OY OY OY!
so basically my birthday is all about you guys this year!
I will sing to the winners of the #ROAR high school contest at 6am (👀) in Denver and then head to AUSTRALIA!
You're welcome. Self love is such an import foundation to have before falling in love.
I wrote This Moment in 1 day it took me 5 months to finish Choose Your Battles. Some come out like waterfalls others drip!
I was influenced to write it after discovering a bunch of people roller skating to deep house in Central Park this summer!
it's my 3rd album (why are ppl saying this) &amp; I wrote about 26 songs or so for the record &amp; not all of them fit! Best ones made it
I have a few great ideas BUT... I will take submissions?!?!
I wrote "we could be legendary lovers" in an email and from the moment I wrote it I knew it was going to be a song!
Unconditionally, of course!
it's inspired by owning up to my part of the responsibility in a situation.
with my friends... 💅
It's about my muse, a present day Penny Lane, “@kaksperry: what or who inspired International Smile? 2323”
it's like someone falling in love with a witch! Influenced by the movie The Craft!
best pumpkin ever!
finally an INVITE!
I read the book "The Power of Now" and that's what inspired it... With a romantic twist!
I will be physically closer to you than I was on the last...
caught.
I refuse to talk about this until hover boards actually exist.
my OG crew, our parties &amp; my hometown SANTA BARBARA! Even my favorite taco joint gets a shout out!
self reflection, love &amp; light...
I just shot it in London last week...
that everyone can identify with a song on the record, there's something for everyone! #somanycolors
I love all my babies but this one is SHINING!!! “@gottabesheerio: do you like this album more than the others?”
acceptance is the key to be, to be truly free. #letthelightin
because it's my FAVORITE one on the record &amp; the message is so universal but diverse about the subject of Love.
this was actually the most fun I've ever had making a record because i had no rules &amp; no timeline just complete freedom!
I think I'm living the most present &amp; aware I have ever lived &amp; that made this time even better. Maybe I've finally grown up?
Mariah Carey, Prince &amp; Wendy &amp; Lisa! Oh, and ya know 😜 “@Katyspad: who inspired birthday ;)”
I feel like it represents so many different sides of me but is the most lyrically dense/vulnerable record I've made so far.
I wrote and recorded the first song back "By the Grace of God" Nov, 2012. MOST of the record was written spring 2013 though.
