All right Joey. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Sounds like a date to me.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'mstanding in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Then I look down, and I realize there's aphone... there.
That's right.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Finally, I figureI'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Cookie?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?
And I just want a million dollars! 
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
 Ooh, she should not be wearingthose pants.
Please don't do that again, it's ahorrible sound.
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.

 Yes, and we're very excitedabout it.
It's a beautiful thing.

Look, Ross, you gottaunderstand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, andthat is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!

'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
You're right, I'm sorry.  "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."

The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how greatthe show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we'rein the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three'sCompany where there's some kind of misunderstanding.

Alright, now try taking a puff.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.

Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?Commercial Break
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's notfollowed by "No thanks, it's late."
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Well, you're gonna.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to gointo your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now thatwasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comesalong, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Yeah. I really do.
Get off!
 What? What?
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Basically we just feel that he's...
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasingafter twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Any contact?
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachelthing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...
I think it's winning.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.Opening Credits
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember,no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
...And what did you bring?
Janice?
 Hey, it's Janice.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumpedtwice in the last five months!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
That's OK.
 What? What can't you do?
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
I hope she throws up on you.
So...
Oh, what a crappy night!
Excuse me.  How ya doin'?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
You got it. Good woman!  Could weget a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've alwayswanted to know...
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Janice is gonna go away now.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hi, Just Janice.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan andJan Forever.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tellyou this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't thingsare gonna work out.
 It is?
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Oh, no I don't.
I did, but...
Call me!
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a veryflattering sleeve length on you.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to dowith them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.
Hey!
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Alcalls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
So.... I quit.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what Iactually do.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's inhis office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I justknow I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it'san all-toast restaurant.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, careercounselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do.You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Who are you going out with?
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,personality tests... and what do I learn?  "Youare ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinationalcorporation."
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should bedoing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doingsomething...something.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better splitthis with you.
 Well.... it is amouz-ing...
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76.  Amouz-bouche? 
....with??
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to gettogether.
Again?
 Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pensfrom your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look,this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something Ican really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure youmentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This isnot a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'mtelling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you onMonday! 
Well?
Look at this! 
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
 OK, that's enough of the view. Check thisout, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
This is great!  Helen, could youcome in here for a moment?
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Last time I do that, I promise.
 Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at theWENUS and I'm not happy!...  Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell yousomething... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good!  Whooooaaaa....Closing Credits
This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was acartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.
It’s Phoebe! Hi!
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Can we start over?
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly likeher sister.
They’re twins!
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Let’s not do that any more.
Your sister Ursula.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.
Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
And  to you too, Helen.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and littlething, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net...
It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that...she’s really really cute.
 So tell me something, is leaving theChristmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Hey, where you been?
Score.
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna runit by err... 
Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?
And?
So what does this mean?
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and myhair was very very &ndash;
Nina? Nina.  Nina.  Nina.
 Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that Icalled you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.
 Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.
I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?
 Chandler: Hey.
You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.
Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kindof capade.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.
Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go,err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact,he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Oh, no, no. Nina...  ..she iswhooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have norecollection of being fired at all, none at all.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can beassured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys andbabies are actually different.
Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?
Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, ofus.
Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.
Sure, why not?
Oh, you don’t know.  Helen, could you make surewe put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
Helen drinks.  Will you marry me?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. 
You’re not gonna lose him.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, mostresponsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Well, only if you order stuff.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
And your friend Phoebe?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd bestarin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
 "Happy Birthday Peehe."
Did you see Betty?
handler: Hey!
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of hisrelationships are affected by this.
You know, you think I would.
What's up with the simian?
Okay...  ..whose turn is it?
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
 So, you feel like a dad yet?
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That isvery dad.
¡Pudo aver sido General Tso! 
Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to workfor.
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go outwith her again?
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've reallyhappened' thing?
...little playthings with yarn?
Could you want her more?
 Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
We're not—we're not saying anything.
 We were playing poker, alright...
And then he did.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
 OK, so now we draw cards.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
 OK, so at this point, the dealer...
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Joey... three... eight. Eight... three.  Alright babe, deal thecards.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving usthe land, so...
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put themtogether yourself, but they cost a little less.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? :"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're allrecommending Trident?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don'tknow... Pictionary?
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This wayI can break 'em up with a movie.
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Couldn't be more out. 
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Call.
: What do you need, what do you need?
Alright, here's ten. 
Good luck.
: I thought we had them!
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport'77! Airport '79!
Go.
Toootal chick-flick.
They're still just friends, right?
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, theywould've happened already?
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Rachel lost Marcel.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some ofthe touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking forsomething...
Yes have you seen any?
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything aboutradiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating andcooling... mileu.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they'revery hot.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Marcel?!
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex Ihad would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would muchrather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as oneof the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally beourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'mright, right?
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended upusing the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
 And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Hey Rach!
Yes!
I have my reasons.
 Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting themachine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!
Hey, I've been honing!
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? Imight have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the pastfew hours.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Can I use your phone?
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
She answered.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and ischoosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
If it helps, I could slide over.
Hello? Hello?
So how's Mindy?
Hell is filled with people like you.
...And boogie!
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
No!  Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler!  I'm fine.Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, Iaccidentally shut off my phone.  Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay.   She's on the other line, she's gonnacall me back.  She's on the other line, she's gonna call meback, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
'S'why I'm dancing...
Ring dammit, ring!
What?!
 I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
What are you doing here?
...I'm, I'm okay.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Okay.
...I dunno.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing abouther coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?EndThe One With The Fake MonicaThe One With The Fake Monica
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey... Switzerland?
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Might wanna try Joseph.
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is theFiddler on the Roof.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
So what does this mean?
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adultalready?
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's atotal party zoo.
What?
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
...Take off their hats!
You're kidding.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
...He's in.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in SanDiego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Tell me what?
 Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason whywomen won't look at me.
Wow!
More importantly, was I any good?
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
You're okay there?
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i wassomebody else's subconscious.Opening Credits
Hello Rachel.
Pirates again?
 Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She ishaving one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, becauseit involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
When we were?
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Can you hear that?
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
What?
Ah!
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Okay.
Bye bye.
 Yes?
Ooh. 
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me.
Why not?
What?!
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
What are you talking about?
I can't belive it.
They do me?
I don't sound like that.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
That is so not... That is so not...That... Oh, shut up!
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to getout of gym.
Tyrannosaurus!
Work people? Nobody told me.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
You think I should?
Okay.
Okay.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and Idoing Ebony and Ivory.
What?
Then, I don't get it.
They do?
I just wan't to...
But I just wa...
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on mydesk by nine o'clock.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston,Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
 Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Yeah, like in a cab...
Okay, hating this.
Here we go, here we go.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the50's.
You have to pick your moments.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
 You see what I mean.Opening Credits
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
You'll get one.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us aremarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
No, no, no.
 Uh, uh.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! 
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, yourfather a doctor?
No reason. 
Where have you been?
Mazel tov!
 You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
 Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian lifepartner?
I know, I still am one of these.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. 
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now oweme... 17 jillion dollars.
... And where's this money coming from? 
 Men are here.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Crazy bitch.
Hey!
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Forget about her.
Course there, they just call it food.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
 Ooooh. 
 OK, this one right here is from me.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? 
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love withCarol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
 ahem... um... Crystal duck.
 F-hah.... flennin....
 Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
 H-He's in China!
What about the time difference?
Yes!  You're never gonna make it!
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! 
Hey, big...
 ...spender.
So how'd it go?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you knowme.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the paraderoute.
I didn't know you had another level.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
 No way!
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I liketo be surprised.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Not yet.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we leftyou, you were totally in love with, you know.
God?
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'msorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all byhimself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
You have to really wanna see it.
 Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
What stupid thing did you do?
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've gotpants that need to be altered.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
At least as long as I have the pants.
 Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his handup my leg, and then, there was definite...
Cupping.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught betweenthe moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
That's ok.
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. 
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question aboutbreast-feeding?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
Hey, sweetums.
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That'slike cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
What did you just do?
What did you just do?
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Howdy.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
 What do youcare? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
 All right, say you do that.You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. Andthen where're you gonna run?
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're madeof. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre westof the lingerie.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nicehooker.
Hey.
Huh. Opening Credits
Morning.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home fromwork today and just hang out with me.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is gettingdivorced. I'm such a grown up.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Nope, not this time.
I'm not yanking you.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
 I'm not breaking up with her! 
Hey!
Of!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I gotthree tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
No, Janice.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have aproblem with Janice?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Well, there you go.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters.
I want you to say that you like her!
Thanks for trying.  Oh, and bythe way there is no Count Rushmore!
Umm, yeah.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Okay.
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
I know!
Okay.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all theselike, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at theXerox place....
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. Andyour like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can'tpossibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it'skinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
You said...
What are you guys doing together?
Really.
You still can't stand her can you?
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Well, I guess that's something.
Okay.
Oh God!
Really?
Taste it.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Hey, mister tux!
 All right, I took thequiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men.  Get up.
You're in my seat.
'Cause I was sitting there.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew Iwas coming back.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not abig deal.  GET UP!!
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.
Really!
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I justhope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here.  Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Nottouching can't get mad! 
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm soooo, comfortable.
All right! 
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, andI'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! 
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, havenoticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair,dillhole!"
What are you doing?
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
 The sheep.
He took my essence!
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody hiscushions.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
He's got nothing!
handler: Oh, aaaah!
What are you supporting?
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
 You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. Butwhenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean,what is that about?
They got a phone in there, right?
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Oooo-ooh!
Jeez, what a baby.
Stop it. Stop it!
Excuse me. Hi.

Come on, tell me.
What?  What are you, what are you talking about?

I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guythat breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you arethe reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matterhow nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.
Then don’t leave me!

I can’t remember which sister.
Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
 You see you can’t tell which one is which either,dwha!!
Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the redskirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overlyfriendly, and I’m sorry.
Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
It’s gotta be the first one.
Yep, I’m in a tree.

Okay, absolutely!
You’ve got it. 
What?! 
Don’t worry.
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on thatas long as your wearing that towel dress.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,y'know he's the botanist.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
 It must take you forever to find your keys.
 Hey, so can you make it on Friday?

Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothinglike a cool, crisp New York evening.
Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, becauseJoanna’s such a big, dull dud!
 I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it allwrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime.I’ll give you a call.’
That’s what you say at the end of a date.
To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standingthere, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
 Oh, well give me the phone then.
Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say,‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’
Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goopthing in the corner of her eye!
All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than anhour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybodyever again!
That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.
It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, and it’s all the time.

Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.
I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I wasgoing to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And thisisn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when itcomes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. AndI’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.
Yeah, o-okay.

Doug!!
I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you expressyourself.
No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah,the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’sjust that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making allthe other guys jealous.

To pay for the gym.
Hey.
Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
I could die.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Hey! 
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
  Wish me luck.
Wish it!  Hi. Hi, I-I was just sittingover there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Oh-oh-hey!
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. 
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate howI could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
 Hi!
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight overthe remote.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would'veknown you guys were... I never would've...
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearsewith him.
Is it on?
Hey! 
Oh! It's on! It's on!
There we go little fella.
Well the duck can swim.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, shesaid the funniest thing about--what?
No, I don't.
Thank you, Ross.
All right.
All right.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy!  Kathy!  Fetch! Fetch it!  Kathy! Kathy! Kathy!  Kathy!  Kathy.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Okay. Commercial Break
 Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love youChandler!
Really?!
 Right in there!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over theconcept one more time.
Hey!
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get mestraight through the week.
You-you do?
You got me.
Yeah. Right.
Okay.
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnetstockings.
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. 
What?
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I am pretending.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinkingabout her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'mso fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for everyminute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met herfirst!!
Can I sleep on your couch?Closing Credits
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Well, I have a call in about that.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of herfavorite book.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talkedto a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her somethingreally great.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
 Sure...
I don't know... um, Grease?
Rent?
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
A pen.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delvecciofor her birthday?
For three years?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a presentfor Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible thingsfor Kathy."  Can you give me ahand with all this stuff?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want herto have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Where?
I got something for her.  It's a book!
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the VelveteenRabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likesit, okay?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh yeah? That's great!

Hey! Happy birthday.
No he didn't. 
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also aclock.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
 Goodnight.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you...you don't always know the exact time.
Uh, the book?
What do you mean?
 Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that soundwas, "Uhl, ell."
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Goodnight. 
 I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathynaked! It was like torture!
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s badenough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I thinkshe knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird likeenergy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seenher naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine herbody was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth!Smooth! 
 Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  Sothings didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
 What?
Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endlessline of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. 
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. ButCasey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense thatshe’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.
All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know?Make a choice, pick a lane.
All right! Bring it on, you…
 Oh my God! Play!
Really, bitchin’!
You mean like, music?
Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breastsare just as firm and juicy.
Come in!
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. Souh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I like it in the stern.  …of theboat.   Hello.
What happened?
Why can’t you tell her?
Joey! Joey!!
I thought your time ran out.
 Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, hesays he’s sorry.
So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.
Yeah, I think it is!
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…
…and then it got canceled.
Really?! You do that?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  Y’know who also hasgreat hair is Joey!
What-what ‘cha doin’?
‘Kay.
 Oh the phone! The phone’s makingsounds!  Hello!
Hey it’s Joey!
What?
Okay.
Oh yeah man.  Joey. 
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Oh.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Okay!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappyforever. Sound good?
I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.
 Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see,you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.
I-I think we have too.
Bye.  Are you still out there?
Hang on buddy! 
I sure did.
Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nicefor my friend.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. 
Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, I don’t know.
You mean with Casey.
Or Casey.
Could be Casey.
Consider Casey.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
I kissed Kathy.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’llunderstand this?
Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Isit?
Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
God!!  What am I gonna do?!
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Yeah, I know.
Hey!
Is that a real thing?
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lotactually.
Yeah.
What?
Oh uh, when?
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.
Yeah?
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to youabout. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
It’s me. I’m the other guy.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got totalking, and one thing to another and…
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
How is that worse?!
Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I thinkI’m in love with her!
You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Probably because…
 Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in thesame room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I…
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m…
 Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him lastnight, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,‘cause I wanna trade for her.
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpackand she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran offwith it…  Oh, there was no bigdog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put onit…  Her initials…
Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Thanks.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
He’s really picky about his patients.
 All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress withJoey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammedthe door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for youroffice.
Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonnaget stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Like?
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Big dog?
I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumblessomething in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Hey Joe.
Hey! I’m sorry! That—where are you going?
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
What?!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say thatI’ll stop seeing her?
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at leaststay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with therobbery and all!
What?
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to besomething that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get init for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?
 Sounds like a really badidea to me.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Air hole! Air hole!! 
How do ya do.
What happened? What happened?!
Gotcha! 
Sorry!
Okay, okay, you got it!
You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension bymooning you guys!
You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I wantyou to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.
Absolutely!
So?
Yeah?

I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!
Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’knowyou’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple ofbeers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.
It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
 Hello.   It’s Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out allnight!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
All right!!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs werelicking your face?
Well, those were seals, man.
Yeah, all right.
Actually, me too.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think Istrained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’rejust not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in acomfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
Hey, look at this!  They’re lighting the bigChristmas tree tonight.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I reallywanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.
Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do youwant me to set you up?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longerfeel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just sohe could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.
 Yes.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’mnot gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of afling, that might be all right with Rachel.
 Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care tostay, but sure!
Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!
 Hello, children!

Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?
 Yes.  Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, Ithink you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s aswimmer.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of creditcards.
See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…
Oh yeah! With who?
Yeah.
Hey, man!
Well, like father, like son.
Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? Ithought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was justlooking to get—oh I see.
 Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?
I’m not Jewish, so…
Bad dream?
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?

I’m sure you’re right, but why?
Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.
I know! I know!
Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody!You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, Ididn’t have to lie once. 
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Oh, it doesn’t matter.  Hey,y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna comewith me?
Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadianswith no teeth.
Have you ever been with a woman?
So there is no good time to ask that question.
I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
So what job did you get Joe?
You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony PlayStation?
Oh, yeah, sure, it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Yes. Right where?
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
All right, we haven’t had sex yet. Okay, what’s the bigdeal? Y’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to thenext level.
No, he’s right, I’m totally lying.
Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey.
No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likesto agree with him a lot.
Yeah?
All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. ButI’m just doing it for you guys.
Hi.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
It was fine, y’know? But she didn’t agree with me asstrongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I’m allright with it."
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with awoman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice. But I need toknow what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody’s killing her inthere!"
Look, you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! She’shot!
 There are seven?!
 That’s one?
Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.
That-that’s bad?
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
You!
Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. We’re getting a second opinion.Opening Credits
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
I can check that for ya.
Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in evennumbers.

Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
 Stop that now!
Yes!
Diet soda.
Orange juice.
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!

Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Unfortunately that is correct.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroyyou.

But if we win, we get your apartment.
Okay. 
Dangerous Liaisons.
Oh!

Fancy guest.
Thanks man.
You can’t just call Monica’s room.
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.
Hey!
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Well believe it baby!
I knew it!
Cool, girl roommate.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining movingday for us!
What?! What-what is it?!
I can’t believe we live here!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! Iget to have sex with the star of the play!
I know!!
Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worstnightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy onstage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’sgonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, "So where’s yourboyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?" And she’ll go, "No-no-no,it’s Chandler." And he’ll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Really?
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Yeah, I know but…
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals,muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certainare the same thing.
I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joeytold us what this means!
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearlyyou’re having sex with him.
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’reup there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denyingthis!
Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!Commercial Break
Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happyto hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it!  I don’tlive here! 
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to BeefsteakJulie’s…
Yes! See you and I have always been like—
Did she call?
All right, maybe I should call her.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.Back me up here, Ross!
That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage andthe heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Oh my God!!
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry.Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completelyunderstand why you were so upset.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is agood thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.Y’know, I know for me—Nick’s pants?
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.
She is now.
I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I meanyou think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, withhis rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, Idon’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just calledher after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and theywould’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here.Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you.  Well, except you. 
 Wouldyou give me one minute!! Please.Opening Credits
Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really,thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out ofthis chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is theone? My sweat pants!
That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk andsee some strippers.

Ooh, let me talk to him!
Well, can I just…
She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!
Ow!
Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.
Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. 
So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?
Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. 
Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go backin time.
 No you can’t.
You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy andwouldn’t live as long. 
Okay. 
No thanks, Mom!
Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’mjust gonna go home and call Kathy.

Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue wascorny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can getyou some free white out though.

Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.  Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Because I’m cooler.
Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.
Plus, you look cool.
Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much hashappened.
Phoebe is, making people.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would evenknow I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.Okay? Something huge!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’sjust, it’s just steep!

This isn’t one of those uh, y’know "If she doesn’tcome, we-we don’t, we don’t come?" Right? Because I already bought myticket…
Oh, that's Ross's.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love withCarol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
 F-hah.... flennin....
I KNEW IT!!!!
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here thatthere’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!  "It’s almost as good as being there."
Well, You could, but... probably just the onetime.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Hey.

You slept with the stripper?
Hey!
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? 
So you might say, it’s a magic ring.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, whydon’t you be my best man."
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had hercome to my office?
 You be cool. 
Way to be cool, man.
Marry me. 
He will, Joe.
Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.

How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. Iam not going to be embarrassed anymore! 
Hey. 
No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that youwere embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel anybetter, I’ve had a really lousy day.

I’d like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will betomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a longtime. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend.  And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he overinflated her.  Ohh, DearGod..

Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the bestyou'd ever had.
Why?
What's your point?
 Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there'ssomething you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Whichwouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with meagain, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!

Yes that was mine.
Yes that would have made more sense.
 Hey!
I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kindasucked, huh?
So, I guess this is over.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
So, this isn't over?
Really? Okay. Great!
 We're in a relationship?
Okay.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second? 
Yes. Yes. 
It happened in London.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Fun's over!
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Sorry.
Hello!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingersbloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
So you're really okay with this?
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.We should get them together and make a continuum.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
So, rocks.
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would'vehappened.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animalrights thing?
Uh, Ross?
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Hi!
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?

Okay.
Are you all right?

That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!

Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
And you're okay with that?

The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?

It's true.
Again true.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guysfrom the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you're old and small.[Time lapse, Rachel is coming back from Chandler and Joey's.]
Okay, hold on.  Okay. 
 If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have aproblem.
Oh the humanity.
More so than anything else.

Why am I looking?
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.

 Hey!
You ready?
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Let me see the earrings.
 They look great! Does your boyfriend have the besttaste or what?
 Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Hey man, what's up?
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Yeah.
Well, I like danger.

It is starting to get dark out there.
 Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.
Your tax dollars?
 Wow! That sandwichreally does smell good.
I can't smell your sandwich?
Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay.
Yeah.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
How do you figure that?
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
 Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
What's going on?
Uh, HELLO!!
 It was a car backfire!
Who jumps at loud noises!
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I thinkI'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. 
 Oh my God! 
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
What picture?
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, buty'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before youwould for me. That's the bottom line.
From a bullet!
Much sense?!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Really?!
Thanks. 
 Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Hm-hmm. 
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
 Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Okay.
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
 Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It'sfast!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! 
So, what are you gonna do?
Me?! Why me?
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'ma lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
 Still terrified, I'll take care ofit. No problem. Opening Credits
Hey ladies! What are you in here for? 
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in withyou and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you twoare gonna be y'know, live-living together!
You mean scared.
Scared? Happy?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you livedwith Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go tobed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move inwith her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
 Yeah, you're right about that.
Hi!
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very luckylady.
I’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Hey Gar!
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
All right, let me in. 
What?
I'm not a dropper!
It's throwing and catching!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard. 
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Not fun anymore?
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you canwork it out!
Oh that is over!

Thank you.
 Hey!
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat orwill all these sweater vests be enough? 
What?
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a bighotel suite?
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a bighotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
All right, bye-bye now!
Okay!
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the roadonce.
Yeah.
Isn't that Ross's money?
I don't know.
Okay!
Too dry.
No!
No!
Yes.
I also said, "Yes!"
No!  Ahhh!!!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question likethat I'll lie.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out rightnow!

 Hey!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game whereyou-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was thatuh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to doanything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, heshould've pushed me off of the bridge.
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some giftsthat I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear withone leg?
 Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!I wanna talk to him!
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to himif he won't even talk to me?
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket ofporn…
Really?
 Hey!
 Is that Joey?!  Let me talk to him![Cut to Joey]
 Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him allweek! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it inperson.[Cut to Joey]
 Hey![Cut to Joey]
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want toprove that to you in person!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Uh, what was that?
 Hey!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just yourannoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Okay.
Wow!
Do we have to?
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Yes.
It's a great idea. 
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.
 Art lover!
I said art lover.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
 Happy plane-aversary.
Can I give you a present now?
Okay!  Oh man!Don’t tell me I did this!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present,please forgive me" not fake out?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversaryever!
What-what Richard thing?
What Richard thing?
 I'm not mad.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!It's no big deal. 
Oh my God.

Why?! What happened?!
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don'thave to share everything with everybody.
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me aboutit!
Thanks. 
 Next time?
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Fine with me!
What are you talking…
Really?
 Joey, I uh! I can't believethis is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Whoa!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper bodyand hit Richard from behind with a stick! 
Good luck!

What's an identical hand twin?
Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?

No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
No!
That was Joey!
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Really?
Okay. 
 See you later Mon.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Come on! I was there!  I know he's the love of your life.

Hi!
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
It’s a buffet man.
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get marriedyet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming outof that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
What?!
 Hi.
Hey!
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
 You did.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’sfree, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.
I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they haveall the marriages thing? I love you.
Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, sosay uh, say you roll another eight  then there’s a definitesign that we should get married.
Sounds great.
Ready!
 Yes, yes eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.
That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing, right?
Well you did pull his hair.
I’m not getting into this again!
 Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.
No!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? Imean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Me too!
No!
Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! 
 Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpackhere?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’msaying?
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Okay!!!!!
Okay.
Oh thanks.
The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t getin!
This is not a sign!
It’s an old key!

Are you hugging the door right now.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.

Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!Opening Credits
Who was it?
Sure!
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe itcould be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like SpaceInvaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interestingidea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."
So, that’s it?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room,especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautifulguest room. 
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
 "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,non-ugly." Nice!
Hi.
Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have agame room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t getgirls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you.  Not-notthat I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I seewomen…
Really?
Ohh.
That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for usboth to enjoy the room.
We don’t have to come up with this now.
Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we canmake in the living room?
Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture tomake room for my chair. 
Is that a problem?
Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everythinghere is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
In the game room!
All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring overthe chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambianceover here at Grandma’s place!! 
 You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here. 
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! 
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot forthe love.
That’s laughter.
I don’t know.
Yeah, I do.
He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.

See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve beenplaying these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have ourown zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be incharge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they puttheir hands around… 
Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.

Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
What equity investments?
You don’t even have a car!
And?
There you are.
 Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, theycan meet Krog! 
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Glass, sand, whatever. 
 All right.  I thought about it and maybeyou’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And itturns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.  
But you found the keys to his clothes?
That is true.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.
I think that’s gum.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.
 Hey!
Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroythe universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
And protected them from a tornado?

Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babiesall by herself.

No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’ttake it.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know?But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Hey!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Yes, but for the last time.
He’s at a dinner party.
Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, onegoal, $1,000.
Oh yes!
Okay.
No! No! No! No——one can beat me.
See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to doall the kicking.
Still broken?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about alittle uh, a little Blackjack? 
Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play anew game. A new game, it’s fun.
Cups.
I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy andreally, really fun.
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens,what do you have?
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?
You’re kidding right?
Well that’s a full cup! 
You win.
It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. Thatmy friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Not 700 exactly?
Double it! 
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive thedoubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing yourtotal to 1,500.  Don’t get to excited because that’s notgonna happen unless you get—No way! 
What’s wrong?
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Oh man!!
All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!
I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And yournice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?
When did I try to give you money?
I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure thatyou’re okay.
 Hey.
I know. 
No problem roomie. 
Sure!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Exactly.
It’s not a real game! I made it up!

Is this a service you’re providing me?
Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.

Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

Uh-huh.

Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going forspring break? 
I can see it now, "Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!"

Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just movedacross the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for Monica’s allergies.  You’re right,I could never lie to you. She hates you.  Should I get that?  Hello?  Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I

 You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set ofgolf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from theLiberace house of crap!
 Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk aroundsporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. 
 I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity thefool that. . . 
 Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got totalking, and one thing to another and…
 No! No! No! I just kissed her.
 How is that worse?!
 You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over theline.
Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! Butyou’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!
 What happened?!!
 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And wherethe hell is all of our stuff?!!
 So--You got in voluntarily?!

Janice?
Janice?!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran hishand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Cupping.
I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?
 I KNEW IT!!!![The next flashback is from The One After The Superbowl,Part II.  Monica and Rachel are fighting over who gets to see Jean-Claude VanDamme.]
Oh my God!
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe?   Hello?  Damnit!  Hello?  No, Joey’snot here right now, but I can take a message I think.  He’s still got achance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news!  Well no obviously not for theactor who was mauled by his dog.  Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joeythe message. Thank you! 
Please tell me you got the message!

Yes, we were just…

This is going in your book?
Hey!
Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithfulservants!
So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?
Yeah, you wish. 
Who?
Hmm.

Oh my good God.

Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you arethe queen of everything.

Right here! 
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before mewere you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 whoare available by the way!
Okay.
Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know thatI’m just not ready…
Okay. 
Totally.
Yeah, it’s beautiful.
I know.Ending Credits
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? Ican’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!
No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t wantMonica to find out.
Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my bestfriends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Me too.
Hey.
Oh all right.
Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too andI can’t find the perfect ring!  Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring!  It’s a beautiful selection. 
Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring.  Oh, this one’s nice!  I like this one! Sir? Uh,kind sir? Can I see this one?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and askme to marry you?
 Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How muchis it?
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Uh, credit card.  Oh no! No-no, but Ileft my credit card with Joey.  Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.

I’m a little busy here Paul.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.  Oh hey! There you go.  Okay. 
Okay! 
Do you have my credit card?
Thank God! 
Oh, I can’t go.
Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go withthe one I picked first.
What?
They put you in jail?
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
It was the ring!
I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumballmachine looking ring!
No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could seeMonica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes.When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and thenI can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thingI’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
I can’t do that.
Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on herfinger.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
 Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’mgonna need to have that back.  But, in exchange I’m willingto trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew.
No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring.You don’t want to break her heart now do you?
Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.
 Okay, that’s enough honey!
Great! Okay, here. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And youare about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! I’mmarrying a dead woman!
Guys?  I’ve got something important to tell ya. Guys?  Guys?!  I’m gonna ask Monica tomarry me.
Yeah, check out the ring. 
Yep, pretty much.
 Heyyyy—What?
Okay!  I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was officialy’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my bestfriends.
I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I know.
Check out the ring.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You canunderstand that, right?  Guys? Guys? EndThe One With The ProposalThe One With The Proposal
Okay, well tonight’s the big night.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knowshow expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’mjust gonna propose.
Yeah.
I’m not gonna mess it up.
She’s not gonna say no.
Hey!
 Give me it!
Phoebe!
 Hi Monica.
Hey!
 Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’regoing to dinner remember?!
I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’regoing.
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids.
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!
Will you marry me? Will you marry me?  Hey, you marry me!  What’s going on little elves?
Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be asurprise and she’s gonna know.
 You are beautiful.
 One nation, underGod. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  I remembered it.  The champagne is here. 
Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Iseverything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
Oh, yeah.  Uh, no youcan’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you weregoing to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, areyou okay? Are you okay?
Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time nowand I think, the reason is you.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and Icouldn’t imagine growing old with…
 I know, but just letme say it.
What?! I’m Chandler!  Oh, that’s Richard!
Hey-hey, hey!  I don’t know why I didthat!
 And uh, you don’t have a mustache whichis good.  I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.
Hi.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us!  See I, did it again.
Yeah, I’ll sit down. 
Yes. 
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both myparents making love to the same guy.
What?!
 Before you say anything, have wegot a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Richard!
Oh you knew that. Good!
For camp!
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re notcareful you may not get married at all this year!
 What did you guys just do?!
Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, butnow you’ve ruined it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriageis the last thing on my mind.
I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do Ilook? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
Hey!
Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary itis and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, whywould anybody ever want to get married huh?
Eh…
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage isunnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigsdon’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in alifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what thedivorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind ofstrategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
 It’s okay, I got a plan.
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
What?!
My—Oh my God!
He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’msupposed to do that!
Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna goover there; I’m gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!
You’re right.
Okay.  I’m gonna get the ring!I’m gonna get the ring!  I’m gonna go find her and  I’m just going to propose!
Okay great.
What?!
Where is she? I’m not scared of you! 
 Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on acoaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Well where did she go?
Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…Ithought you were a good guy.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend thatyou love her?
Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did?My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just aplan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all thesethings, she’d be surprised!
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, thisisn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! Andthis is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for eachother! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonnapropose tonight.
Yeah I even  got a ring.  Didyou get a ring?
Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
What?
What are you talking about?
Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell herit was a plan?!
Well where… Where did she go?
I can’t believe I ruined this.
Oh my God.
Okay!  Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought… Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that itmattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters isthat you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make youfeel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?
Hey.
Monica and I are engaged.
Thanks.
 Okay, you get her in here.  You bolt the door.I’ll be in the closet.Opening Credits
It’s okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
To Monica!
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Okay.
Know what I mean?
There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Twohundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
 I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’mfascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high schoolI uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. 
Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood. Hey!
You look great!
You okay over there?
Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you hada lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
 Take whatever you want, just please don’thurt me.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look,you are definitely 19.
Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed becauseeverybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Joe?
Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?
Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kindof eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t….There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
It’s happened to you?
Well, what’d you do?
 I don’t think that’s what they were talking aboutJoe!!
What?!
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Yes!
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There isgoing to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’sgoing to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not justbecause it’s romantic, but because I can!
Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.
It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!
Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
 Ahh, third base.
 Why to save your dignity my man.
Well, somebody should. [Cut to Rachel’s bedroom.]
How is that ever going to happen?!
 I don’t care, she slept with me.
Thanks.
 Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider ita deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Okay. 
What’s the matter honey?
 Already?!
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
What in God’s name is that?!
Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymoreand Derrick…  And Derrick is a name Ishouldn’t know.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who areactually involved in the wedding?
Okay.
Centerpieces!
Definitely roses.  Well, I justthink they’re a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Uh-huh!
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.
What a sweet story.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourthwedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has hesaves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.
Honey, it’s gonna be okay.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we loveeach other and that we’re gonna get married.
Well, I have some.
Well, close to… 
Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on thewedding?
Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and Ikinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of themoney on one party.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answeris no.
Yes, I am!
Hey.
Ehh.
Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we shouldspend all of the money on the wedding.
Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I toldyou that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makesyou happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Yeah.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small placeoutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know,we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time itran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garagewhere Joey could grow old.
Sure you do.
You sure?
I love you so much.
Oh yeah, totally!
Hey, you guys!
So, what do you think?
Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you ahint. 
I got glasses!
No I didn’t!
No!
Really?
 You didn’t think I used towear glasses, right?
That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, soyou don’t have to get us…
What we want honey.
Dying people say the craziest things.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
Hey! How’s the boat?!
Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.
Do you know what I was thinkin’?
Nothing, I just like to go like this. 
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Then free as a bird. What’s up?
Well, did-did you correct him?
Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.
Does anybody know me?!
Don’t worry about it Pheebs.
An old cookie?
We can’t accept this.
‘Cause it’s gross.
Okay, we owe you a present.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. Wewere bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Daddy. All right look, here’s the story.  Well, we had just finishedplaying racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it wasreally steamy.  So I take off my glasses andthat’s when in happened.[Cut to the flashback, Chandler’s no longer doing the voice-over.]
Guys?
I know.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then themarriage is off!
 All right, I’m off to see your dad.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the storyanymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face Idon’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. 
So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if youdidn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m alittle embarrassed about it.
What did you do when they found out?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!Ending Credits
It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
And say nothing?
No-no-no-no.  Hey! 
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets betweenone another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I donot have any secrets from you.
Oh no-no, I can’t do that.
Okay.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at thisrestaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk ofhis car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain andRoss starts to feel a little iffy.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe’s secret?
That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
 Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tellher I am sick!
What about him?
Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow!Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey.
Oh it’s always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! Youagain!"
Hey.
Oh yeah?
Did you not understand the story?
Hey! What’s up?
Huh.
No!  Shhh!
Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! 
I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couplescan’t keep secrets from one another!
Du-ude!
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear legwarmers!
Ross came in forth and cried!
 Of course it is.  Wow—whoa!
Hey!!!
That was you!
 You have no trouble telling time now right?
Quick! What time is it?! 
Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married thatwe should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang outwith…all the guys in my office.Ending Credits
Hey.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
What are you guys doing?
Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’sgoing like this… 
I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.
Yeah, I’m not in that.
All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.Opening Credits
How about those three pointers?
And those guys were this  close to lettin’ us play this time too.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I meany’know you can’t date him right?
Dude that is so sad.
Could I play?
Okay. 
No, I am.
I do? 
Okay. 
Aww! 
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
I can’t help it!
Borrow money from me?
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Hey!
 I’m right here!
I’m still right here!
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Can you people not see me?! 
There I am!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me anantihistamine.
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way toBrooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because Iknow how to take a picture now.  Okay, see? Look down , lookdown, look down… 
 Yeah! 
Ahhh.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
Okay.
I’m marrying her.
Die Hard still great!
What’d you rent?
 Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets allworked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
That’s sweet.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thingcalled a mirror?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both notattractive…  Hold on one second; let me check this out. (Hegets up and grabs a photo album.
Well, let’s see…  Okay uh, isthat her? 
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
 No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for twosummers, and then I broke up with her.
Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gottenreally fa-aa-aw-ow…
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she stillfeel bad?
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Can you figure out what I’m doing?
Who?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to thebathroom?!
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a betterperson and that is not the man you feel in love with!
 Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you rememberme.
 It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have brokenup with you because you were overweight.
You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, Iguess my work here is done!
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’mgoing to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
I would really love it if could do both.
What?
What?!
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but Iwas 15!
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin,beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologizefor later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still loveyou.
I’d carry you around in my pocket.
Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
…Come on! Why are we here?!
The hot chicks?
Wow that’s actually pretty cool.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?
OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? Youdidn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?
Did she freak out?
Right.
 You said no right?
You said no right?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your babyis so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!
What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? Youdon’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’sgonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what?She’s probably not gonna even want to come.
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Yes!!
Yes!!!
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about thewedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even surewhy we’re having it.
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
 Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. NowMonica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Say again?
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I just wanted to show Monica your book. EndThe One Where Chandler Doesn’t Like DogsThe One Where Chandler Doesn’t Like Dogs
No, no, no. No-no-no.
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name allthe states in six minutes.
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at leastone, or in some cases... fourteen .
Oh, okay, time's up!
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables,Joey?
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.[Cut to the girls in the kitchen.]
Oooh that may be a New World's record 
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. 
I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globein your apartment.
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's likeold pumpkins or something.
Which smells delicious!
What?
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
What is it doing here?
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5minutes, my throat will just close up!
 Really?
Well, it still has to go, right?
Okay, it's um…
 I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they arethinking, and that scares me a little bit.
 Is there a puppy here?
 Okay, you are new!
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, Idon't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!![Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]
 Here I am.
How did you…know? [Phoebe waves Monica in. Monica sneaks in with the bag with Clunkers in it and headsfor Phoebe's room.]
 Where's Monica?
Why not?
Well, I, I should go in there.
Why not?
This is ridiculous. 
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
And that doesn't scare you? 
No, no he went for a walk.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.Y’know, for you, and… I left the door open and she must havegotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof,which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so,so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. 
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
 It is so good to see you!
It's up to you.
All right.
You got it.  You got Nevada twice.
Yeah. EndThe One With All The CandyThe One With All The Candy
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. 
Okay. Okay.
That sounds like my first bike.  Mydad gave me his old one.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
I’m sorry, who?
But we don’t know the neighbors.
Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!
Well, either that or uh…
 Am not!
Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please?
 4:00 A.M.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!  He does not know that I am not some of us.
Mm! Night Gar’! 
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
 What happened? I’m just eating candy.
Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and goodworker.
What is the matter with you?
Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex reallyloud?
handler: Yeah, that’s her.
Y’know what would work?
Stop making candy!
You mean they like you.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
 What is going on?
Joey!
What are you doing?
Get in here!  Hey, and you can not smoke in here!  Merry Christmas.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This womanwas trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get toknow all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
No not  Candy Lady.
All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it!You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!
You’re welcome. 
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.Eh-uh—are you okay?
Buh-bye.  I just got us reservations atMichelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday seasonas a betroughed couple.
…betrothed couple.
Hey!
Pheebs?
Skull?
How long have we been home?
Lovely!Opening Credits
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonnachange your last name to Bing?
Why not?
Hey!
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still beliving with him.
No reason, except…she…told…me.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monicanow.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
 Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Give him money? It was a joke!
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'dappreciate it. 
Okay. 
Had the money in the wrong hand. 
How do you know so much about this?
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Mustached bastard…
 Excuse me...[Chandler can't find his money in the pocket. In the meantime, another couple shows up,and Chandler turns away to look for his money]
 Ahh-hahaha! 
Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Definitely noteasier with coins.  Thank you.
Hey Pheebs!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entirebuilding, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or avile of small pox to release in the hallway?
 Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Hey! 
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,weird…turtle-man?
What?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his handsweren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho!
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santacostume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Why?
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Santa? Really?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Then it's okay! 
Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo?  ...areever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out ofEgypt. 
Ohh. Mmm.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
 It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sentit to us.
I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can'treturn a box after you've opened the box.
Because it's too delicious.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna sendaway for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecakeconglomerate,  Momma’s Little Bakery.  I feel terrible,I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
So…
Oh, what’s at 8:00?
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn. 
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
I can’t seem to say goodbye.
Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
 Y’know what? Forget it! We are justhungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunchand forget about the cheesecake.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Well, thank you for lunch.
So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?
Mrs. Braverman must be out. 
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her tocome back to bad cheesecake.
Well, we don’t want that.
But we should take it.
Why?
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regretit.
What are you doing tonight?
Dude! Dude! 
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
That’s what Monica said.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat thecheesecake without me?!
Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And Igot it first, and I’m takin’ it back! 
Oh yes!
Oh yes!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!
What do we use to split it?
 Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh…There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…
All right, I’ll pick that one. 
 Ohhh!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don’t comecrying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in thehallway and eat my… 
Stick to your side!
 That’s a plane!
 No, I’m not!
Because it’s flattering!  Come on Monica! Come onMonica! 
 Monica!
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was DeepImpact and which one was Armageddon?
Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh!  Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who wereice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time Ilook at that cover I’m like…
What?!  Ow! 
Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’dmake some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? Wecan just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we werefirst going out. It’d be fun!
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
 No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
That’s correct.
 What? What? What?
Yeah! You?
 Yeah?  I hope you’re not thinkingabout cleaning the living room.
Do you know what just happened?
No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
 Monica?
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So pleasewake up so we can do it right!
Okay.
Yeah!  No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay,I am going to make you some coffee.  And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all overthe kitchen floor.
Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can’t believe thatI’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have sevenminutes…
Do you wanna?
Couldn’t I just say, "This is Ross?"
 Sorry! 
Joey! Joe!  Full bag.  Beer’s still cold.Something terrible must’ve happened here!  Ohno-no-no-no-no-no!  Stevie, I was never here! 
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! 
Hey!
Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times theywon’t even let me in the store anymore.
 Are you telling me that you bought the chair that ismaking all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair ofthe Year?
That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replacedit with mine!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
I’m gettin’ my chair back! 
Joey you broke my chair!!
I think I should get the chair!
Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!
Well, where’s the logic in that?!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
 She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainlywasn’t that much fun.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff asock down there?
 Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here anyminute!
 Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for eachindividual man.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that youwould have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I can’t believe thatyou would have a tux that’s thirty years old! 
Ohh! 
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! 
 Okay, everybody stay here. I will find outwhat’s going on.
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surpriseparty for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Yes!
Yes!!
Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee andthey will never know that you’re drunk.
Yeah, I’ll take care of it.
 Okay we have to do something about your breath.
That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surpriseparty. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on herparty dress.
See?  Here we go. 
 Phil.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  Okay,  you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’redoing fine.
Monica’s a little drunk.
 Go change!  She doesn’t want her parentsto know she’s drunk.
Monica’s wasted.
 Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, readthe card! Read the card!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, because you’re not a grandmother!
 Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some ofthat over here please?  There we go.
 How are you feeling?
 Now all you have to do is just get through a little bitmore, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.
Pheebs!!
I think it’s necessary. 
What?
Okay, here we go.
Hey! How’d it go?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
 Monica said wedding.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Too?
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. 
That’s great!
So great things are happening at work and in your personallife!
Don’t do it.
I think it’s the dying cat parade.
 Oh my God!
Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He washanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re halfScottish right?"
Yes!!Commercial Break
Why is your family Ross?!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cooland the Gang.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottishheritage.
Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotlandby…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. 
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
That’s not really important right now. What is important is;while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for ourwedding.
Because we hate them.
We have heard you play.
 Chandler: No!
You mean the spitter?
Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, "Ido," he’s thinking, "Yeah, I’d do her too!"
Yeah!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I saylegitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we werestill together.
Joe…
 Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.
Yeah you can do it.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Our minister…
Okay.
 Should we call the spitter?Commercial Break
Yeah. O-okay.
See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool thingsabout having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
No, not us…  Us! 
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romanticstories. Nice stories.
Joe?
Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room andsaid goodnight.
But then later that night…
 Hey!
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with thebride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset aboutwhat that guy told ya are ya?
Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, andyou’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? Imean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms…  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s goingon? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
But we don’t do that.
How drunk are you?
 That’s the perfect amount!
What?
I know.
Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wannaget under the covers?
Okay!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Yep!
Count of three?
Two!
 Chandler: Three! 
Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectivelyruined.
Eh!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! 
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… 
No! No! No!
They’re in my bag over there. 
Uh, could you leave me one?
Yeah.
No I-I-I’m fine.
What?
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
 So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you everin-intend on telling me about this?
Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If itwasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him  not me!
I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life andI’m runner up.
 Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now.Okay?
Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standingtheir saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…Idon’t know what I need. I need a walk.
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead youhad to settle for Robin. 
Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me butit would probably rather sleep with you!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with thisfantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
That’s what you should say.
When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
I’d love it if you would do it.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a littlebit and some things in life are more important.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kingsthat we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Gap commercial.  So did you book them? Did you call?
Do you want me to call?
Staying out of the way.
Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged.I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
 Smooth.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about themagical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Huh.
Hey!
Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and youdon’t come by? That’s okay!
Really? Right across the street?
When’d you meet her?
Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
Hi! How’d it go?
 Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were inRoss’s situation?
So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! Butunfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way,what’s the name the girl you’re dating?
Bye! Commercial Break
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! 
 What are you guys talking about?
But I love swing music!
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! Andthere’s another reason too.
I don’t want to say.
Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them itwas…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all mydances with.
Hi, honey! I’m home!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scary me.So could you come out here please?
Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!
Well then why can’t I see it?
Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it.  Wow!You-you look…hideous.
Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen.Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’slike yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Okay!Ending Credits
 I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Oh totally!  Pull my finger.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Kinda. They’re really big.
What?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostlypanic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid evenmore sweating.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of ourrelationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna betogether for the rest of our lives.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts,I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sportsdrink.
 Water! Water! Water!
Hey!
Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleeptogether before the wedding.
Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh webroke up for a few hours…
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy anddomineering?!
That’s me! Come on!
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
 Hi! Nice to meet you!
I’ll be right with you.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Y’know I think we should invite them.
Well this is just sad!
Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to knowthat I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
 Well, what’s the deal with these? These-theselook nice.
You mean like for award shows?
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with peopleyelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Okay, who wore those? 
Not bad.
Who’s that?
Pierce Brosnan?
Are you serious?
007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!
Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerfulweapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears noone; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
What?
You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! JamesBond’s tux!
So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married Iwould never do anything to upset you.
That was pretty 007.
Ross is Batman!
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batmanis so much cooler than James Bond!
Batman has a utility belt!
Batman has the Batmobile!
Batman has Robin!  We get ESPN right?
Actually, I don’t like martinis.
Ooh, yum! 
I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?
 Let me try it on!
 Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  What’s this?
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! ValKilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruitylove story where he played a blind guy!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really gladthey’re coming.
 All right! I found one that fits!
Whose is it?
Whose is it?
Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?
Do you realize you get louder each week?
I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
  Look at her go! She must love memore than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.Opening Credits
 Monica, there are no words…  Thereare no words! This should not be this hard!
I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! Youshould’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.
 Okay.[Cut to the girls.]
All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man onEarth. Would you go out with me?
 There are seven?!  That’s one?
Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.
 Monica…
 Yeah?
You'll get one.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us aremarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
No, no, no.
 Uh, uh.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! [Cut to Ross leaping into Chandler’s Hotel room in London in The One WithRoss’s Wedding.]
Nice try.
Look, Monica…
This is not going to work.
You are so great! I love you!
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, Ijust stopped talking!
No I didn't!
No I didn't!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it![Cut to Chandler trying to hint to Monica that he wanted to move in with her in The OneAfter Vegas.]
 Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’msaying?[Cut to Chandler entering his and Monica’s apartment alight with a thousandcandles in The One With The Proposal.]
Oh my God.
Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,I thought…  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  Ithought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thingthat matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my lifetrying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will youmarry me?
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me aboutchicken.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke——Diet Coke.[Cut back to Central Perk.]
It happened in London.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
 Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? 
 Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriateand the pinching!!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Phoebe knows about us!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to putlotion on her!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! [Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]
Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?
 It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm veryhappy were gonna have all the sex.
Not if I kiss you first.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Who are those people?
What’s going on?
So we both finished our vows.
Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.Ending Credits
Okay, what do you guys think?
You really like it?
I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him aninvitation.
I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. Ihaven’t seen him in years.
Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in thesame circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonnabe staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
What’s this?
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’llsave!!  We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can ourwedding be bigger please?
Y’know we already went over this and I won!
Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to seehim. I don’t wanna.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’dhave to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School,he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearingspeedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into thestands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearinga headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as ahealthy snack!
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Does it matter?!
Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.
So I really never get to win anymore?
Yeah, I just ordered a beer! 
No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m notsure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see meeither.
I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kindatried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to NewYork, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Catsin the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it.  Here we go.
And there’s daddy!Commercial Break
Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!
That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into theaudience.
It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at thehotel.
 Chandler. 
Oh, they’re a hoot.
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
I know it would make me happy, ma’am.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
 When I was growing up I…played the one on the farleft.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and themisses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
The young hot ball and chain.
What’s up?
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I’mbuying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
But you’re still my friend?
During this time…are you, are you still my best man?
Do I still call you Ross?
 Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for thewarning.
So are we…friends again?
Okay.  You won’t believe what Monica’s olderbrother just said to me!Opening Credits
 Okay. Here’s a question you neverhave to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearlnecklaces.
Yes, include more people in this.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.
What?
Honestly? Me too.
Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna comeup and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.
Okay. I’ll be right there.
We’re the Bings.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing! 
Hi.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.  
Hi…dad.
Oh my God! [Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller talking to Ross.]
How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’mrelated to Monica. How is she?
No! No! No! I can’t do that!
Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’tbe the Bings!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they usethe pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
No.
It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look ateverybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! AndI’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn!None of my proceeds go to charity.
I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s toohuge.
Well yeah, but then…
Depends on what you mean by we.
No.
Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?
Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
Okay, excuse me for a minute. 
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little freshair.
Okay.
Oh fresh air!
What?
Ross! 
 That’s right! I’m not!
I know about Monica.
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
You don’t know?
Monica’s pregnant.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out ofcigarettes…
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that’s when Iuh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I  New York.)Yeah, y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can’t be scary.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to giveMonica so she’d know I was okay.
You look beautiful mom.  You lookbeautiful too dad. I love you both.  I’m so glad youhere. 
Are you Joey?
You look beautiful. Is this new? 
Okay.
 He’s Greek Orthodox.
 No, that’s okay.  Monica Ithought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when Isaw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprisesthat come our way it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I wasmeant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? 
I do.
 I love you. And I know about the baby.
Our baby.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Then…who did?
Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. [Cut to Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is talking. It looks like when Rachel and Monicalived in this apartment.]

What?! What are you talking about?
Who’s the father?
Why not?
As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
No?
I’ve been taking dancing lessons.
Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will neverforget.
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re allslippery.
Not well.
Thank you.
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Funny: ha-ha or funny: [Time lapse. The band is finishing another song.]
What size shoes do you wear?
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dancefloor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
 Those aren’t eleven and a half.
And the world will never know.
Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days OfOur Lives.
But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actorwith freakishly tiny feet.
Did it turn into sand?
 No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I tookall those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to beseen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Why?
 Hi! We’re checking out of the bridalsuite.
And I’m the happiest guy in the world!  Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forwardto!
We got the honeymoon.

So you don’t have the cameras?!
So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!
Great.
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thingthat was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’tbelieve I screwed this up!
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Are you serious?
Marriage advice? Really?!
I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.
She picked those out too.
That was her.
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?

They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.

Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance…
We really…didn’t get a chance to…
Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!
Y’know who has a great video camera?
Let’s call ‘em.
Here you go. 
What?
I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all thoseinsightful, great questions.
Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. 
I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
 Was that another question?
Did you do it on our invitations?!
So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! 
That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how Iget around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
What’s funny about that?
Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?
The Hard Rock Café?
Again?!
You like the Purple Rain display!  Hey Bob.
Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.
Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean thefirst time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t sayanything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" AndI-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’mstill Toby.
No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in differentdepartments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in awhile. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s callingme Muriel. 
Shh! It is a family name!
Hey Bob.
If I see him, I’ll ask.
Yeah!
We’re on a semi-first name basis.
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know ifhe has what it takes.
But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
I think it’s best sir.
Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder andclaim you never got ‘em.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously aroundhere?!
Sure, what’s up?
Hey Bobby.
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s  right, right downthere.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the jobup here.
Bob!
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
 Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are youdoing?!
You’re an actor!
 Monica!Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume…
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
How is that me?
When have I ever done that?!
Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!
Oh! Hi!
Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as aslutty nurse.
You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxedout.
 Marry her.[Cut to Joey and Monica.]
Howdy doody.
Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.
What question?
There’s no question.
 You picked Ross?!
I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you proveit? 
 You’re going down.
That means nothing to me.  Come on!
And dignity.
Nope! I can do this all day.
God, I’m exhausted.
No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinksI’m a wimp!
You’re Spudnik.
Fine.  Oh no!
Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
No, I let him win—Ross!
Would you tell her I let you win please?
I am strong! I’ll show you! 
Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
Okay. 1…2…3—Go!   I’m gonna kill myself!EndThe One With The StainThe One With The Stain
Hey.
Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.
No, it wasn’t you.
I got a maid. Yay!
Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…
Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adoredthe way that you arranged the sponges.
Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Nowjust give her a chance, okay?
What’s the matter?
See? I told you.
 What?
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in frontof you?
She must’ve been planning this for years!
Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeansmade more than just the one pair?
So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before wego…snooping around her crotch?
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
 Hi!
How come?
To see her pants?
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Oh dear God!
And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.
Here’s another plan…No!
Why?
I fear a jury will see it the same way!
You see that?
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your brawill you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
You need new clothes.
I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
Brenda a bee!
Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo yourbuttons lest it sting you!
You do?
I totally understand.  Can I just see yourbra?
Her what?!!
You had a bachelorette party?!
I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
You went home with the waitress.
I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that thetwo pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
My God! You must be good in bed!
She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think thatyou’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.
What?
Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me astripper…
Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know?I’m not a bachelor anymore.
All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!
And Joey.
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelorparty?
What are you doing?
Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
You’re right, this is more fun.
Hi. 
That’s me.
Yeah, yeah right over there.
That was weird.
So she’s a…
I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missedit.  Ma’am, are you also a stripper?
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.
Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonnahave to burn that room down anyway.
Why would she do that?
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
 In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!
Why me?!
Which is why you should do it.
You do it!
All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?
I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
Well we…we still hang out.
Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m marriednow.
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll maketime to hang out with each other.
Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you reallywant to talk about smoking?
Monica! Wait!
 Carry on.
Could you not narrate?
I have no idea.
Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t haveto help out with stuff.
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  There’s noAnderson.
Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into thegame. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next toeach other.
I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!
 Y’know, it’s been a while since we’vescreamed something. Maybe we should.
Oh come on!
Good game!
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
 Detroit.
Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphroditecheerleader from Long Island?!
I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a50-year-old woman?
Did she look 16?
Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spentmost of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
New haircut?  Necklace?  Dress? Boots?  Boots!
Oh my God!
I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
She had a point. 
Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.
I have you.
Hey-hey.
You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money topay for them. 
 Hey!
 I don’t think you did a verythorough job!
 What’s wrong?
Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. 
Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you canwear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
Why not?
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go withskirts, dresses, and pants!
Okay.
Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.
I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’sgo.
What’s going on?
What?
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It’s oddly unsettling.
Hop on.
Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a littleturned on.
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?
I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
 I don’t have your boots.
Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew ona bale of hay!
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Okay. 
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’msorry.
No.
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpturedoesn’t it?
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.
Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Holdme.
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time ischoking something. Can I choke ya?
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell withthat bitch.
Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.
It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Cokeholder.
Oh no-no-no!
Hi honey I’m home.
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him thatyou and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and thenwhen I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life wouldbe like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Pleasepromise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with eachother for the rest of our lives.
Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding youalready sang…
Oh, okay.
I kinda like it here.
Well what did it do?
A vending machine?
Who cares? It’s a stupid game.
I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.
Why do you want to play this game so bad?
You are not going to believe what I did today!
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! Theyshould change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don’t.
Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off theboard! High five! 
Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosenup. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirtywords.
Because it’s awesome.
Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S itis a bit of a challenge.
It is when you put it together with that one.
Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.
Have you talked to him lately?
No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day!It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look atthat! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
With the claw?!
 Pull my finger——My hand ismessed up.
I did.  But it came at a price.
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
One more score to go! You can do it! 
All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Are you, are you high?
Really? I don’t like baths.
Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.
Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules,how stressed do you think I am?
Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Oh my God, what’s up?!
Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.
Do you?
In London?
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
If that.
Hey.
Sex on the balcony?
What is it?
Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us havingsex on the balcony?
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
 All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flowersmell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.
Oh my God.
I’m going to need a bigger boat.
I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’ssomething wrong.
I’m in the bathtub.
I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The saltdidn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’tcompliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!
The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different. It’s interesting.
Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
I had the exact same conversation.
I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting outwords since we saw him in Macbeth!
All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Uh-huh.
He didn’t say anything about that to me.
He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, ofcourse the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
But what did he mean by rules?
Because he was looking at her differently.
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
You don’t say anything.
I’m not going to let you say anything.
Oh, God!
Do I smell essential oils?
Okay.
L-leaving my troubles behind?
Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.
 Hey!
 You told her?!
 Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
You like Rachel?!
 Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you tojoin us!
I’ll…I’ll get you later!
Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.
You’re not?
Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Hey Pheebs, what’s up?
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.
Well, Phoebe I thought I’d——Yeah, what the hell. Opening Credits
Hey babe.
Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?Maybe we can take it back?
How about to the street say from the balcony?
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
How about the closet by the bathroom? 
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down andrelax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve neverseen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Fine.
 Love you.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for likethree years.  If! I said,"If it helps!" 
I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to openyour closet! I swear! 
Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’sin it.
I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that Ican’t see?!
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
And here we go…
There has got to be a way!
Yeah.  Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-oldgirl.
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
That’s a good idea.
Okay.  So uh,Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her tothe hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong.  Except for harboringan all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’stools.  Oh my God!
 You’re messy.
I married Fred Sanford!
No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you becauseyou’re organized, I love you in spite of that.
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying aroundcan we, can we share the closet.
Hey.
So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Are you okay?
Happy Valentine’s!
 ‘Candy and Cookie’.‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really mustlove me!! 
I love you, St. Valentine.
Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! 
I am trying!
 Why did you get me this?
It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…
I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.
Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
How long it took to go back in the water?
You don’t know. You didn’t see it.
Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? 
See, honey, there’s—
90 seconds.
You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, wasmy father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make thatmy screensaver!
I can do that.
Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
Oh, I know!
Poor Ross.
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this hecloses the drapes!
Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.
Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone beingborn can make you want to kill yourself.
 Thisreminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go.
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Wait, you guys, look!
No, the baby’s out! Look, look!
And look how happy the mom is now!
Oh!  She’s growing inside you.
Oh! 
I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Oh hey!
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for eachother and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.
Why?
What?
Come on, don’t be crazy.  You don’t thinkthere’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? 
A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’retalking about.
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’restill gonna date him?
 What?
What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No?
What are you doing?!
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Is it made of cheese?
 Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?
What do we do?
Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here,browsing through the personals.
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
I’m sorry, did you say cheese?
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe inthat kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand inyour way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
No. But I’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.
You don’t?
So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
I love you.
Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. Ifound this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.
Hey!
I don’t see him.  Do you see him?
What?! No! No!
 I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
 We didn’t play it!!Opening Credits
I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
What does yours say Pheebs?
Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.
Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does thatmean?
I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.
I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcasticcomment? Some cheese?
Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just putit in the nearest one.
In the James Taylor case.
Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them inthe right case.
Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind oforder. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?
They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copiesof the Annie soundtrack.
What problem did you tell him you had?
 The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…yourbottom dollar that tomorrow…  …there’llbe sun.
You can always sell your baby.
Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to showthey’re not in the baby buying business.
Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
I’ll be in there. 
Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who saidthat?
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
What are you doing?
It’s a dog.
It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talkabout their dead pet?
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Ha!
Yeah.
I don’t think the flash went off.
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a hugebutterfly net looking for that man.
What are you doin’?
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could.
If only there was something in your head to control the thingsyou say. 
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk likethis. [Cut to the interview.]
Nice work my friend.
And a bagel with only…
 Hey!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think thecowboy hat is a little much?
All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?
Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
All right, ready?
Two.
Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.
You wanna see if we still have it?
FREE PORN!!!
We have free porn here!!!
What’s wrong with you?
This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to thedoctor!
That’s still in there?!
Stick to your side!
Mento?
Thanks.
Well this one's for you.
No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and Ialso know that this is about more than just jewelry,  it's aboutyou and me and the fact that we're  best buds.
That's what they'll call us.
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
You’re turning into a woman.
Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
Oh my God, introduce us!
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
That’s great.
You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Bamboozled?
 No!
Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Sovietscientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! 
Bogota.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Higher or lower than what?
 Can you believe how lame this is?
This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath… 
Let me see that.
Triscadecaphobia.
Fear of Triscuts?
This game makes no sense!
Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.
Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
Either, it makes no difference.
I’ll take a card.
This game is kinda fun.
I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to eachother.
Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hutplease.
Six!
 Hungry monkey.

Yes!  No!  Google!
Nooo!!
This is the best game ever!!!
Hey.
I’m so sorry.
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much betterjob. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statisticalfactoring for other companies.
That’s what I do now.
The front page? You really do live in your own little world,don’t ya?
 Hey Phoebe!  Fatty!
Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lotmore money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m littlenervous.
Why not?
What about it?
 What?!
Are you serious?!
What is it that I do?
 Did you like me when we first met?
I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last acouple of weeks.
An hour.
Phoebe!
Chandler Bing.
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada.  I’ll let myself out.
…I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’tmicro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.
 What I do do…is manage to uh, create anatmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.
Oh! 
Really?
Okay.
…also I was the point person on my company’s transition fromthe KL-5 to GR-6 system.
That I did. That I did.
 My duties?  All right.
 I see.
 Good to know.
No don’t I beg of you!
 Really?!
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’knowI’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hardto sidestep that duty thing.  Duties.  Duties!  Poo. 
Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, thatwas the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Callsecurity! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!
I’ll look forward to your call. 
Let’s. Opening Credits
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.
I haven’t seen this dress.
You really want to take me?
So you’re never actually going to pay me back?
I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.
 Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. 
This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking ourpicture. How do I look?
What?
It’s just so glamorous.
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
The whole thing! Can we go?
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry!  Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! Istill feel so bad!
I’m so sorry.
What?!
You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…
I don’t know, five hundred dollars?
Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Do you want a calculator?
Here! 
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tapclasses…
Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that playwhere you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came outJamaican.
Yes, money well spent!
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…
Hi!
Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. 
Yeah?
Okay.
Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’reready.
But you said you were ready too.
Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?
I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’mnot saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it.We’re good. We’re really good.
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
We’re trying to get pregnant.  Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.So, when do you want to start trying?
Period math?
Yeah.
Right here?
Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill andwe’re in a building that’s full of beds!
Okay. 
Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights.  Orturn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. 
Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.
Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right nextdoor to hers?
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would meanit’s the end of the world!
Hi.
Weirdest thing. Did I hear——Mother of God it’s true!
Jan-Janice!
Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s theunwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?
What?!
That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then47 hours later here she is.
So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
You do?
Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked goodisn’t it?
That was amazing.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Okay. Wow.
Sure.
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
What?! Why does she think that?
Again, what?!
As we all are at some point during the day.
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much heloves to propose!
Well, what did she say?
Does Ross know?
Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
I’m so tired.  Yeah okay, but noforeplay.
Hello sir, you know Monica.
Look, we can’t stay in here forever.
This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to beashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. 
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, thatwasn’t for fun.
 Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever wewant.
That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet holein my head.
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it looklike?!
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Okay, look, just do it gently.
Hey.
Yea yea. 
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to theoffice  Am I producing them?
Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying aboutthis big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the moreI couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll getsix hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter whatI did I couldn’t fall asleep.
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Walter .
Yep.
 Yes.
 Hey.
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Parisfor a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take apicnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris ofOklahoma?
People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
We’re moving to Tulsa! 
Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me tomove to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently,said yes.
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With AFringe On Top.
No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  I’ll get out of it.
 What is wrong with Emma?
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
It’s a funny story, actually.  I kind of fell asleep inthe meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really knowwhat I was saying.
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here’s thething. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I loveTulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me gothere!
No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?  Wh-why would Iwhen your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping!  That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. Ilike a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. 
 Hey!
Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
We’re moving to Tulsa
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!  Ican’t, I can’t hear you. 
 Hey, what you guys talking about?
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to headup our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
They said it could be up to a year.
There is nothing like the support of your lovingwife, huh?
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna beable to make it.
Really?
 Hey!
I've got good news!
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.You can stay here and keep your job.

Really?
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Hey, you said that without gagging!
I know what she's talking about.
He saw a therapist?
Hey!
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Slim Pickings.
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They'relooking for someone to shovel mesquite.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Can I just say how much I appreciate you comingwith me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still gota lot of packing to do.
What?
How far outside?
And you're thinking of taking it?  So beforeyou said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess nowit's old job,  me,  new job.
What happened to 'you can't live without me fourdays a week'?
I think you should take the job.
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when youstart chattering like a monkey.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometerin your touchy?
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Well, you got here just in time. I really haveto go buddy. 
Of course I will call you. I love you.
Awww.  Bye!
 What's thematter Joe?
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to makeall this easier?

Good morning everyone, its nice to see our team togetherfor the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
 Well, dont believe everything you hear, Ken.  But yeah, thats true. Alright, lets get started, bytake a look at last quarters figures. (The female next to Chandler starts
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right
Alright, lolook. I dont smoke anymore. But if the rest ofyou want to light up, go ahead, its fine.  So you all smokethen? Thats almost rude, that Im not.
 Ken, please! No, I cant, I cant smoke. If I smoke,my wife would kill me.
I always liked you, Ken. 
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areasand offices with fewer than fifteen people.
No! I just happened tdo a lot trivias about smoking indifferent states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are calledLeyhallalookoos.
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Pheebs?
 Okay, something to cover the smell  Ovencleaner!  Unscented!
No thanks, Im good.
 Right. You know what? Actually I just get offthe plane, so Im feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
 Alright, the truth is, I soiled myselfduring some turbulences.
Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay,five. A pack. Two packaa carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But its over, I made a decision, Im not gonna smoke anymore.
But, those are for you.
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Will power? Ive watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
kay, look: Can we just drop this? Im not gonna smokeagain.
You forbid me?
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is shehere by the way?
Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Then, I might as well   do this. Not really sure what to do now.
Fine. What!?
You serious? 
Right, fine, Ill do it, but no talking.
And no kissing your neck.
And lots of kissing your neck.
Look, I cant do this. I cant make luv to you while werefighting this way.
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Im not gonnado this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Mean it?
You are incredible. Unless, IIm not gonna smoke again. Andif I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. 
Yeah, lets celebrate life!
Uhh. You are welcome.
What?
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple ofcigarettesno big deal.
Leave it.
You tricked me to get me into bed?
I feel so used.
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulativeshrew.
You mean the lully story?
Oh yeah, thats what she says. But maybe youre notovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
 You not gonna believe this: She lied! She trickedme into having sex with her.
Whats the matter with me? Why Im such a girl?
handler: Mhum.
So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
 Hello?  Hello?
Honey, you're screaming.
 Oh, that's great.
 Awesome.
 Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knockjokes...  Save it forinside! 
Hey!
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, theycall it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahomahaving a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm fromthe waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
 And don't getme started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... twowords just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And friedchicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Yeah, he came up...
 Were you there?
Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monicais around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
 Well, thank God yourlivelihood doesn't depend on it.
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guyshe's ever met.
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Yeah!
Ye.... 
Hey!
What are you guys talking about?
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I dodraw the line at a male wetnurse. 
If I'd known you guys were coming over, I wouldhave brought more pizza. 
What is so funny about that? 
Did you tell her what we talked about? 
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? 
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man namedChandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friendhas any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keepit smart, people!
I love you too.  And... I like you as a friend. 
See ya! 
Hi!
How come?
Do you have any ideas?
 Oh, and you know whose knowledgeof her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I justhope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt?Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
mmm That's enough about you!
No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together.We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
We're not gonna have this conversation again...Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, thishuge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying aboutlosing Monica to a real man!  You don't think he's here, do you? 
 Look at these videos. You know, I mean,who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh myGod!
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Get there faster! 
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watchit... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  Well, weknow I'm gonna watch it. 
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... andyou found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you needto know what was on it?
Some girl...!?
Yeah...!?
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it'sprobably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possiblybe as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is...Please?
Why am I hearing cheering?
Football? Just football?
It's football... It's just football... This is great!This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary toget a beer... What the... What are you doing?
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the pornstar!
Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a matureman like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'dbe another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy andmoustaches.
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly notover you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow amoustache!
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rollingaround with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see howit ends.
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride'em cowgirl!
Is that a problem?
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use ourwedding china today?
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
What is the point of having them if we never usethem?
I will explain it to her.
Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woohoo!
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytimesoap Days of Our Lives?
What are you going to do?
Well you proved them wrong.
I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minutethis isn't the china we picked out..
Why?
Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?< Phoebe comes in>
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
You know, guys I got to say. This means so muchto me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monicaand I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubtsabout my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <startsto cry>
No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustratedat this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?<Ross and Rachel pause and ponder this>
Actually what?
What?
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enoughto raise Emma?
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but doyou really think I'm not capable?
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knockson table>  she'd have to give her up.
So.. let me get this straight. So my two friendsdie, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope leftin my life gets taken away from me?
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raisepoorly?
Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strongfather figure and I never will be.
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they saidwas exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybodyknows it.
Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Goto your room! You're grounded"?
You said that to me last week.
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don'tknow anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and Iwant you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok.
Alright! That is it. This is our apartment andyou can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn'tbe here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink onesI picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologizeto her right now.
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologizeto each other and mean it.
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Okay, but you should know he eats five times aday and shoves pennies up his nose.<Ross ponders that and walks away>
Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compententand totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right thereEmma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box ofchina> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.COMMERCIAL BREAK
Nope...
Yep...
Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna...put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we shoulduse these plates again for a looong time.
Maybe not even then. 
 Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
So, who does?
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Thanks.  I'll see you New Year's Day.
Did I not mention that?
 AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair!  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
Hey. Where've you been?
 You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
Haha, no thanks!
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
What? That's terrible!
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Why?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
OK, Pheebs, your turn.
And, a lemon lime.
And last but not least.
 Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Hey! 
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
What?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Why?
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Santa? Really?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Then it's okaaay! 
You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Good, God's speed, good people!  You're not gonna go?
Ah. Thanks.
Ah.  Chandler Bing.
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
I sent them home.
Uhh, uh...
I don't know!
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
BE-LOW me!
Well, she... she didn't win...
Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
I'm serious!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, you guys!
 The wife says "Hi!".
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! 
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
 No,... no...  NO!  Look, I'm, I'm married!
I'm *happily* married.
Right. So, I'm sorry...
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
But we don't do that.
How drunk are you?
 That's the perfect amount!
What?
I know.
Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?
Okay!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Yep!
Count of three?
Two!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh! [Flashback to 503 - TOW The Triplets]
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
Really? Okay, so...
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Right!
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Let's go! 
Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
I don't think so.
 Here just...take this. 
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Okay, one thing at a time. [Flashback to 702 - TOW Rachel's Book]
Ehh.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Yeah.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Sure you do.
You sure?
I love you so much.
Hey!
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Monica.
I never want to leave you again!
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
 I have *not* thought this through!
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Thanks!
 Ahh...
 Here, pass these, will ya.. 
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
I don't have a *job*!*Closing Credits*
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...   Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Hey!
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
How long was I in there?
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because yourcheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
Honey? Leave it to the pros.
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
Really? That's great!
It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight.Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Yeah.
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Hey.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsoleteand we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby,I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Or a year?
It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
I quit and you learn what I do?
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
Hey
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice- not helping.
handler:  Hey! Happy birthday ...
handler: Hi.
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Now that Rachel's gone?
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
 and Chandler: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
You don't trust him?
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?Because I could get a job any day now.
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you knowas well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,he's going to have sex with it.
Picturing that tree?
Where you going, Joe?
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Your thoughts? Plural?
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Great novels?
 I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
 Right behind you, big guy! 
handler: Come on! Joe!
 First I was afraid, I was petrified 
 Hi
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
Hey!
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird likeyou! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did whatthey did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
No!
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monicawe should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold,nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there theywill"
So are you gonna...talk to her?
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells itand spits!
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea whereyou're moving?
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Why did I get married?!
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving ongoing?
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know Imean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,twoillegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was justan impulsive one-time birthday thing
Did she go out with him?
Ah! The high road...
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
I thought I had to make the jokes!
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friendRoss right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We onlyneed six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
We still got it!
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate,you're asking women how they want to be killed
By drowning or...?!
Well...
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, AshleyJudd?
I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Ok. First of all, this is green!
All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me youwill not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing thelawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrowsof my father and his “business” partners.
Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help VictorVictoria!
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and mygentle self-loathing touch.
And done!
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a littleworried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out tobe a little piece of chocolate.
No problem.
Yeah.
I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll seeJoey.
Really? In front of all this people?
Oh my God!
Are those my wife’s nipples?
I gotta stop this.
You, touching yourself, out!
“Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, neverunderstood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine.” So youjust touch yourself for anything?END914 The One With the Blind Dates914 The One With the Blind DatesWritten by Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen PlummerTranscribed by Marita Bakken
See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'llexcuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Wow.
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? Imean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
I don't do that.
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Today is the sixth.
Yes, it's also 2003.
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Tough crib.
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
I - I don't think I can.
Because of Emma.
Sorry.
Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...canoodling in it.
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in frontof the B-A-B-Y.
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, youwouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring throughthe window.
Emma was doing it!
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
I think we may have really done it this time.
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Where's Emma?
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Okay. 
All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica'sovulating.
No, no, no.
What? Why?
Your family name is Tribbiani.
 Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…
Thank you. I got a job in advertising. 
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
Right. So, it'll be the same except… less sex with you. 
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating
 Humiliating and noble!
 Good morning, everybody.
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope 
The comedian? USO?!
 Honey, I'm old!
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. 
They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
What am I supposed to do with these?
Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps".  And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  Would you help me try to sell these?
No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Hey!
Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…
Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
 You know what… these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Alright  I feel youger already!
 Yah, I think I broke my hip.
Okay…  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me 
 I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
The cold weather hurts my hip!
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a dealout of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe nextmonth we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey'srefrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backingsoda and beer?
No! We're not borrowing money.
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thingmy father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the poolhouse... but the other thing was never borrow money.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us throughthis situation even if it means you working twice as hard.Opening Credits
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Yes dear.
Hey Joe!
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anythingabout it.
And that would have made the official party line.  Monicaand I are having a little financial trouble.
What? What do you mean you know?
Oh! Right.
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! 
Oh ok.
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
What?
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that shewouldn't tell me about?
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thingI would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...single things.
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And morespecifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger wouldyou? Don't answer that.
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't changea thing. Not a thing.
Yeah?
But honey you don't have to.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
your ass?!?!?
They...do that?
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to geton more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
 What?
chel, Chandler: It's over/Joe!
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrowhallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it getsreally tricky.
Aaaaand....... hernia.
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live withthis ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. Ending Credits
Hey! Ready to go?
What are you doin'?
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
Oh, I'm so sorry!
You're not gonna need my help?
Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth 
I believe I read that somewhere!
I respectfully disagree.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
I don't have a page.
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!  I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
Oh, you'll see my friend.
 And so young.
Well, how you died was funny.
It kills over one americans every year.
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
No, come on, you know that's not true.
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
There you go! Someone came!
 Please, come in.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps 
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
 Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! 
Ok! 
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. 
Kori? Kori Weston?
Wow! You look amazing!
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! 
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300million? No thank you!
Still on Amelia Earhart?
Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to getstruck by lightning 7 times.
I'll ask. Boohaki?
Kinda like Joey.
Pie eating contest?
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'llget it, I'll get it!! 
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Damnit. Alright call me whenyou know more.
One of the slots got filled.
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Yeah I know.
Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wannaget one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't careabout Charlie.
I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friendfilled with regret eats own arm".
Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we canprint whatever we want.
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do ifwe win?
Ooh! Calm down ...
You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way togo.
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15seconds.

Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody elsehear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept withhim!! .. Alright, bye. 
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
He's the boss's son.
What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
 She's right, you shouldn't have boughttickets just for us ...
Let me finish ...  however, itdoesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to haveprinciples, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! 
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things aregetting squished...
 Hey, there's twomessages. These could be from work!
Ok, here we go! 
This is..shhh!
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130chances to win, right?
I got that!
No.
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'mnot used to getting it from guys.  Hey, Steve.
Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm nottoo mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see youtomorrow .
What?  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a juniorcopywriter.
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Thanks, man.
Really? What?
 Oh yeah?  Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heartright out.
Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years orgo for the big payout.
Me too.
enters)Chandler:  Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Are you really that busy?
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule.  "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it  Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time?  Oh, can't you make an exception?"
 "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"  "Oh, thank you very much!"  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
I don't have travel insurance.
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
New York.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
That's insane!
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.
 What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Dude, you're shaking!
USA Today
And I also got... two more apples.
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Ok, how about this ?
Yes, but the batteries...
s his hands)Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
No!
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
tions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
What?
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
There's a forest right outside.
Ok, go quick!
I got you something from Vermont! 
 Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
I could fall asleep at a play.
 Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Hey!
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
 No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Where the hell is everybody?
 oh yes, God yes!!
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
es. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)Chandler:  So, how did you enjoy the play?
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Did somebody sign your bra?
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .Friends - The one with the fertility test
I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?
 So, a professor, uh?
Oh, yeah?
Oh, well... Maybe we could... 
We really need to take those tests?
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
 I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst thanon a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do Iknow that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Deposit my specimen? You know,usually I have to call a  900 number for that kindof talk. Thanks, got it.
Yeah, I guess!
Oh, Come on!Commercial Break
Why are you here?
 No no no... I mean, why? why isshe here??
What!?
I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  gota hot date... 
 I think it just fell off. 
 My specimen is in theroom and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.Really helped speed the process along!  Janice! You're not... gone?
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
 Yeah, but what if it's not? What if thereis a reason why we can't have a baby?
 oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believeI didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...come here and do... 'that'...
 It was a "Wendy's!!"
 It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.  No, she's not herebut, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this?  Oh.  Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. 
Doctor Connelly just called.
Actually it's both of us.
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitableenvironment.
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungersand you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  Itmeans...
 It means that we can keep trying, but there'sa good chance this may never happen for us.
I'm sorry.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
 Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Hi.
Oh, DAMN IT!
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
 Hey guys!
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
But you come first!
 Ok.
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Yeah.
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
 ah-ha!
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
 So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Ok!
 Zack!
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
You don't like him.
Alright! Just follow my lead!
Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
 That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness 
handler: Sure! Alright...
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
 We're teeth people Zack!
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Ok.
I think we've found our sperm!
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Yeah, he's better!
Really? Are you sure?
 Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
So you know this leaves us with...
How do you feel about that?
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
 Yeah.
We are gonna be great parents.
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
Hey, Zack!
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Really?
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?EndFriends - 923-924 - The one in Barbados
Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
 She does?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
Oh, because his penis was too big.  Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
What?
I didn't mean now...
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
 I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Man, that's some bad advice!
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!
 Nice! 
Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? 
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
That would be advice!!
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
 What?  May I?
 Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
I just feel awful.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... 
 Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
And there's not chance that will work?
 Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
This vacation sucks!!
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
 Not to mention the cold sores.
 Really?
I don't think so!
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
And...?
I'm not playing with you.
She gets crazy! This scar  is from Pictionary!
 Oh dear God, there's two of them!
 Did you know this about him?
 OK!
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
 Do you really find this attractive on him?
I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
 Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
But...
What about the obsessive cleaning?
You ok?
No, you didn't.
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
 Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
 You're welcome, sweetheart.
All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
And that's... how... it's done!
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
I don't know.
That's why!
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
You're on!
He could be alone. This morning I heard him dopush-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Wow!
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?No-one is manning that wall!
Anything?
You do realise  that's your brother?
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leavingwith Weird Al.
Okay Buckwheat!
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...Miss Congeniality!

Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will youdo one thing for us? The people that  care about you?
Enunciate!
Hey!
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'mjust finishing packing.
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it'sa New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and theears.
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't careabout your social life.
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don'twanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
So if you want people to see them, then by definitionyou're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
What are you singing?
It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "ApocalypseNow"...
Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said wasthat I could see your scalp.
Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachelsaid, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Hit yourself in the tooth?
Honey, you've been in there for a long time...Is everything okay?
Really? What happened?
You can't move at all?
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of thecorn rose?
 Some of these look a littlefrayed.
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing alittle something for me?

You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," Iimmediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in thisroom, huh?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
That's great.  Can I see the book?
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Hey, you must be Owen.
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
You know how to use a compass?
You do? That's fantastic!
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to yourparents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
What?
I got nothing.
Where are Bill and Colleen?
We have to leave!!
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I mayhave told him.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level healready knows?
See? Intuitive!
Which technically now you should give back!
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there orsomething. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in thedoor. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santais real."
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the tripletsthat you gave birth to them?
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. THE ENDFriends - 1003 - The One With Ross' Tan

 Why...why?
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you canreally show it off.

Are you trying to do a British accent?
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !

Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthdaywas!
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of thisparty...
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the partyshe knows is happening.
I know, what are we gonna do?
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!

Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away togetherand things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. 
Was that Emma? Is she up?
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!

 What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!

Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Me too...
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
I was kidding.
No, not yet.
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? 
Let's do it, come on!
Thanks!
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
So excited about your letter!
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
That's where people make number two!!OPENING CREDITS
 I don’t... uh... understand.
On every word?
And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapienswith full sized aortic pumps...?
You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write fromhere,  your full sized aortic pump.
I doubt that! Tell her about us lastyear.
Word!
She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were aguy..?
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
It's ok, it's ok. You know what?  I'll justcall the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. 
 Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just droppedoff a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh...okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
 They loved it.
They thought it was very smart of us to have achild write the recommendation letter.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
That sounds like fun.
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
 Chandler: Hi Ross.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It wasin a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys myblack book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.With Janice's phone number on it.
 Hey honey!
Is Monica not here?
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding fora big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideaswere mine!  Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas weremine!!!
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you'reright for the part.
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't thinkyou're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
Software that facilitates inter-business networkinge-solutions?
Hey you guys.
Joe, I told you, you're just not right forthe part.
Joe...
Fine!
Work, Joe!
He's not right for the part. So if I suggesthim, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they shouldlearn on their own!
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake,go to work! .
Hey Joe!
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it alongto my bosses and they weren't interested.
 I'm sorry man.
 Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.Stupid sons of bitches!
 What!? Of course I did!
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
I watched it!
  I did!
 I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone)No!
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
What did I just say?
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I aminsulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
He really is a chameleon.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. AndI promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the partor not.
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for youto forgive me?
Lying is wrong!
I'm a pretty little girl.
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard thenumbers.
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cuttingsolutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
 Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Hey!
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaningthe apartment.
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
 Little people?
What...? NO!
 I don't, and I'm offendedby the insinuation!
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is notmine.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile. 
But you already gave all your money to charity!
I don’t think you can do that!
That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actuallyto death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...as allowed by law.
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
What?
Of course it was!
RAT BASTARD!
 Chandler: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's greatwithkids though.
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. 
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
 You can't make this stuff up!
What the hell are you doing?
Well, we're not.
We don't have a code word.
Any room that isn't behind this couch! 
 You have to get out of here. You sleptwithour social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, soshe can'tsee you.
Ok!
What?
And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! Andwe don't want to buy your bat! 
I can explain... Joey...
Oh, that's really ok.
Wrong number?
That's great!
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?COMMERCIAL BREAK
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
No, no! We made this decision together.
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?OPENING CREDITS
Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Somebody is gonna pick us.
I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!
 "The Firm"?
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Tell me more.
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Oh my God!
Hmm, the game's at one.
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
 They're out there!
 Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
 Ross' shirt is torn.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?
 Oh thank God![cut to the hall]
 That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. [cut to the hall]
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
The cranberries...?
He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! 
The floating heads do make a good point.
Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
A little late for that.
Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Can you ever feel your ears?
 Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Come on guys, PUSH!
handler: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
My cranberries!
Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
 Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
What's going on?
And?
Are you serious? 
That is the exact same thing.THE ENDFriends - 10.09 - The One With The Birth Mother
 Hi!
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
And so incorrect!
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Yes, but...
Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!OPENING CREDITS
Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
You're gonna be great.
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Ok.
That's what our friends call us.
 I don't think that's exactly...
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Yeah, wow.
No-ot for me it doesn’t.
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
Yeah, I did.
We are NOT signing those papers.
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
You have gotta stop!
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
I know..
oh, honey..
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
You're Jewish.
Hey.
The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Erica wait!
You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
You still want that baby?
 Seriously, answer faster!
 It's like a giant hug.
 Hello.
Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Those are all really old!
Hi!
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
I don’t know. What do you think?
I do too.
I know.
I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Hey!
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Actually, we already found a house we love.
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?TIME LAPSE
I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
 You know that's not the reason Joe. 
Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
If you win, we give up the birds.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Dangerous Liaisons.
Fancy.
Fancy guest.
Thanks man.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
 Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! 
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
 Hey.
I know. 
No problem roomie. 
Sure!
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Here, here!
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
 Okay, thanks...  They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
I know.
That's okay, we understand.
Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
We got the house.
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
We're getting the house.  We're getting the house.
We're growing up.
So who's gonna tell them?
Not it! Damn it!COMMERCIAL BREAK
You'll see.
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
What did I marry into?
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
 I'm leaving you.OPENING CREDITS
Who?
 Did I go to this school?
 Sure, nice.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Hey!
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Fresh!
Mint!
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
I said it first, bro.
 Look, if you did...
Totally. I had sex in High school...
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Your hands are shaking.
 Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Oh really?
Oh really!?
ADRIENNE TURNER!! 
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Really?
Aren't you...?
 Right.  So how're you doing?
Hi Monica.
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. 
Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
 Hmm mmmhm..
 Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Not her!
Soo... you girls having fun?
Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
So where are you applying to?
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Why?
You kissed her that night too?
Seriously, where did this happen?
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
What did I marry into?COMMERCIAL BREAK
Hey!
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
 You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Heh.
This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!
Thank you.
I know, I hate being left out of things.
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
What happened?
 M-Me-me-me!
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
You are going downer!
 I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! 
Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
 Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
How's it going?
 That's what I was doing too.
You too.
Me too.
I'm not supposed to tell you.
You told us both we could be in the wedding? 
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
I'll tell you at the wedding.
So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
 I'll do it.
 Na ha ha...  Ne he he...  Ah ah...
 Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Oh yeah! 
Ready?
Okay.
Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
You look beautiful.
That really was an incredible wedding.
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
So, where's Mike?
Hey.
Why are you wearing my apron?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
I'm so sorry...
Monica. Calm, self.
Why would you say that?
Great!  This baby'd better to be really good.
 New York is awesome!
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
That's great.
So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! 
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
Hey! How was lunch?
 Oh, really?
O-okay.  So, is she gonna take the test?
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
How do you know?
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
 Shovely Joe!
Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. 
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Mrs Hannigan?
Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Damn it.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
That is a bad interview.
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
To Ross!
And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
What?
When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Hey.
Really? What changed your mind?
Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Ha! I'm just messing with you.
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!
Excuse me?
For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
How did the job stuff go?
That's great!
How did the job stuff go?
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. 
Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
I see.
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuseus, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
What do you think Pheebs?
Yeah.
You're kidding!
Oh yeah?
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross theAtlantic.
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
It feels like we’re cheating on our house.And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house,that does stuff that our house won’t do?
And yet I never run into Beyonce!
 Don't, don't! 
 Why!?
This can not be happening!
The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other coupleare the Hitlers.
That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,but when did you start crapping money!?
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes onour house. We can still get out.
Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louderout here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"!
 Well, wehave to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too. 
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going tobe here.
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
I never stopped loving you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you JaniceLitman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid andMonica never have to know a thing.
 Obviously.
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
I understand.
 They're never coming down now.
Hey!
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Where's your passport?
Well, it's not.
We're taking a break!
Jumping on the bed?
No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
 What the hell is this?
I didn't know Monica had these!
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Hey.
I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Yes, Joe?
Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! 
. Well played.
Uh, Rach?
 Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. 
No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Pheebs!
I think these are yours.
Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Mine was a humdinger
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
 You couldn't be cool. 
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Monica's grandmother.
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Oh my God!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
What?
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Oh my God!
Next time, can I say breathe?
Where are you going?
You can't leave me alone with her.
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am notcomfortable with!
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alonetogether.
Okay.
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder whichis worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one willever know, because no one can experience both.
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, whoknows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things?Like this.
Is it really that bad?
I'm okay.
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Wow!
 It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And someother stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Well, that's spongy.
I know. He has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
Okay.
How do you feel?
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!COMMERCIAL BREAK
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?
What do we do?
 Twins! Twins!!
Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keepone, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, andthen years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean,that's a great day for everybody.
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
 Okay. Shhh...
Okay.
Okay!
 She? It's a girl?
 Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived inapartments next to each other for years, and then one day they'repushed through a vagina and they meet.
Bye!
Have fun at church-camp!
I know! You ready to trade?
Okay.
We could trade later.
Hey.
Her name is Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more timetogether.
I love you.
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, butnow we understand you were doing this.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Alright.
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Okay, let's find these birds.
Well, that can't be good!
How?
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey, wait! The ball!
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
No... It's all glued together.
I don't know. Maybe.
I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Did that movie ever get made?
And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
What's the matter?
I understand.
I don't know. Except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game,good game, good game, good game, good game.
Well, I can't do it either.
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
That was... Impressive.
Sorry about the table, man.
You gonna buy a new one?
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better getused to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus,here they'd have their own room.
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lamecool guy handshake?
Wow, this is weird.
Where's Ross?
 Look around, you guys. This was your firsthome. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. Butmore important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Oh, okay.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Sure. Where?
